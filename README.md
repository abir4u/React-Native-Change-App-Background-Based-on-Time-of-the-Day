# React-Native-Change-App-Background-Based-on-Time-of-the-Day
This project targets to:
1. set background image for different screens of app
2. to change it dynamically based on the time of the day

About the App:
The app has two pages:
1. The Login Page
2. A Welcome Page
No Authentication has been applied on Login page as the app is developed to play with the background image only.
So if you click on "Access" button from Login page, even without putting a username and password, you will navigate to Welcome page.

How to Test the App:
Load the App. You should land on the Login page.
Considering that it is Daytime at your place (say 10:00 AM). Below is how the app will look:
