# React-Native-Change-App-Background-Based-on-Time-of-the-Day
<b>This project targets to:</b>
1. set background image for different screens of app
2. to change it dynamically based on the time of the day

<b>About the App:</b>
The app has two pages:
1. The Login Page
2. A Welcome Page<br />
No Authentication has been applied on Login page as the app is developed to play with the background image only.
